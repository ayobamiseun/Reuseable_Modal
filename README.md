# How to Use a Reusable Modal Component:

Import the Component: Import the reusable modal component into your application.

Open the Modal: Create a trigger event, such as a button click, to open the modal. You can pass content, title, or other parameters to the modal if necessary.

Display Content: Define the content to display within the modal. This content can be a message, a form, an image, or any other relevant information.

Customize Styling: Customize the modal's appearance, such as colors, fonts, and animations, to fit your application's design.

Handle Actions: Implement event handlers to manage user interactions inside the modal, like form submissions or button clicks.

Close the Modal: Provide options for users to close the modal, either by clicking outside the dialog or a close button within the modal.
